# Design goals
Breeder_blanket_model_maker is a parametric 3D geometry maker for creating detailed CAD designs of breeder blankets. The main goals of the software are:
  - Automate the process of creating blanket models
  - Accelerate the use of parametric design in fusion
  - Ease the process of optimising blanket designs across disciplines
# New Features!
  - Create detailed parametric HCPB, HCLL and WCLL blanket designs
  - Produce blankets with fillet corners poloidaly or toroidaly
You can also:
  - Import a blanket envelope model and start forming parts from it
  - Export geometries of different components in STEP format
  - Export first wall armour with your specified thickness
  - Export a first wall with your specified thickness
  - Export end caps with your specified thickness
  - Export the desired number of rear walls
  - Export polodially segmented breeder zones with uniform or repeating structures
  - Export radially segmented breeder zones with uniform or repeating structures
  - Export toroidally segmented breeder zones with uniform or repeating structures
### Tech
Breeder_blanket_model_maker uses a number of open source projects to work properly:
* [FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org) -  a fully scriptable open source parametric 3D modeler
* [Python](https://www.python.org) - a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more effectively
And of course Breeder_blanket_model_maker itself is open source with a [public repository](https://github.com/ukaea/breeder_blanket_model_maker) on GitHub.
### Installation
Breeder_blanket_model_maker requires [FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/Installing) v0.16.670x + to run.
### Todos
 - Write MORE Tests
 - Upload tested source code
 - Write user documentation
